# AB_test_analysis
This is the third project done on [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program, where I analyzed results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Getting started
You need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* random
* scipy.stats
* statsmodels.api

## Statistical analysis
* [Bootstrapping sampling distributions](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-the-bootstrap-method-58bcb51b4d60) and p-value calculations
* Z-core test
* Logistic regression
* Multiple linear regression

## Key findings
* The conversion rate for the new page is not better than for the old page
* The country parameter of the user did not impact the conversion rate
